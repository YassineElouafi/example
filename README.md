# Example Blog for Gatsby & Hyde

# Goal

Have a blogging support system that aims to be as simple as Jeykll, but with the underlying power of Gatsby.

There is a high-level goal of supporting all of the features that have been built into the Artsy blog over the last
7 years incrementally.

# This Repo

This repo serves as the example blog for development of the system. Once [gatsby-themes][themes] becomes stable then 
it can be turned into a theme instead.

# Features

These are the goals, not where it is at today:

- [ ] TypeScript support
- [ ] Archived pages
- [ ] Author pages - [mine][author]
- [ ] Category pages - [GraphQL][graphql]
- [ ] Site series - [React Native at Artsy][rnaa]
- [ ] Multi-author posts - [Pair Programming][pp]
- [ ] [GitHub Issue Powered Comments][ghc]
- [ ] Real-time [search][search] on the static pages
- [ ] Static stand-alone Pages - [Artsy x React Native][x-rn]
